# JavaTutorial
Quick! What is the difference between int and Integer? Even if that was too easy for some, having strong fundamentals are great for the begineer: to coding, to Java, to being rusty. Sometimes a touch-up of underused information is good for solving new problems, having a common base with fellow programmers, or even sharing of fun facts around the water cooler.

This project is the repository for a blog I am currently working for this purpose. I felt rusty after some time not coding or teaching Java, and I wanted to accumulate some knowledge in an "easy to reread/relearn" place.  If something I cover here helps me or somoene down the road, that would be great! 

So all of the topics covered here will be examples of basic topics, done in Java 12 (for now).

Any further questions? StackOverflow or (email me)[cking5496@gmail.com]
